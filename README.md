This is a bunch of F5 iRules for LTM load balancers.  
Good practice with iRules is several smaller rules chained
as needed rather than individual monolithic rules for 
each instance.  Also, a script to interact with the API - it's 
built for an older version of code - I need to update the 
github version with something more recent.

For more information on iRules and there writing thereof,
check https://devcentral.f5.com/irules

That site has lots of reference info and a fairly robust and helpful 
community.
