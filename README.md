This is a bunch of F5 iRules for LTM load balancers.  
Good practice with iRules is several smaller rules chained
as needed rather than individual monolithic rules for 
each instance.

For more information on iRules and there writing thereof,
check https://devcentral.f5.com/irules

That site has lots of reference info and a fairly robust and helpful 
community.
