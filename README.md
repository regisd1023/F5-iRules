This is a bunch of F5 iRules for LTM load balancers.  
I finally pulled these out of another distro and dropped 
them in their own for simplicity.

For more information on iRules and there writing thereof,
check https://devcentral.f5.com/irules

Lots of reference info and a fairly robust and helpful 
community.
